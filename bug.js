This error occurs when using the FlatList component in React Native and trying to render items that contain dynamic styles based on their data. The issue arises when the style prop of a component inside the FlatList is recalculated for every item rendering which leads to performance issues and inaccurate styling.

For example consider the following code where the backgroundColor is calculated using the item's data:

```javascript
<FlatList
  data={[{backgroundColor: 'red'}, {backgroundColor: 'blue'}]}
  renderItem={({item}) => (
    <View style={{backgroundColor: item.backgroundColor}}>
      <Text>{item.backgroundColor}</Text>
    </View>
  )}
/>
```

In this case the backgroundColor style is recalculated for every item despite it being constant for each item.
